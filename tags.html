		Tags in HTML are the word or abbreviation between the angled brackets(< >) that are<br/>basically the lines of code in any other coding language. There are some tags that every web page needs 		to have, such as the &lt;DOCTYPE&gt; tag or the&lt;html>and&lt;body&gt;tag.
		Most of them have a starting tag and a ending tag, starting tags are just the word in the angled brakes, but the ending tag has a slash in front of the word. There are some exceptions, 		<br/>such as the line break tag(&lt;br/&gt;),which is a self-closing tag, has the slash on the end of the word and do not need a ending tag.
		Some tags change the way the text look, such as the &lt;font&gt; tag. But there are hundreds of tags and I canâ€™t put them all in this slide.
